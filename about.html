        <h1>About FLO</h1>
        <p>
          Consumed by air suspension, FLO Airride Co-Founders Mike Alexander and Eric Conner teamed up to breathe new life into the air ride community, taking their collective passion for creating works of art to a whole new level. FLO Airride Mfg. will focus on high-quality air supply products that perform as well as they look, getting back to the basics and taking a designer's artful eye to every single component.
          <br><br>
          Form meets function and modular personalization is key. Taking each piece of the puzzle and dissecting it, probing, testing, breaking, and then breaking again - it was possible to find and eliminate the weakest links and design high-quality products built to stand the test of time. Stay tuned as we continue to redefine <i><strong>The Art of Air Supply.</strong></i>
